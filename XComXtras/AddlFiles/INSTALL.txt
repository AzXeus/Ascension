===================================================

Ascension requires you to have previously downloaded the Long War mod in order to be installed and it to be a clean Long War install.
This mod utilizes PatchUPK.exe to perform the install of changes to core files, PatchUPK is a mod created by WGhost.

The Long War mod can be found on nexusmods.com.

If there are mods that you really enjoy and would like to know if they are compatible with Ascension you can contact me(Dethraker) or Azxeus
via nexusmods.com via private message.

NEW INSTALLATION STEPS

1. Make sure you have a fresh install of Long War 1.0.  We have not tested for compatibility with most of the other mods for Enemy Within or Long War and it's very likely
with all the changes we have made that other Long War mods are incompatible with Ascension currently.

2. Copy the Ascension folder(the folder downloaded) into your XCom Enemy Unknown folder.  
   e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\Common\XCom-Enemy-Unknown

3. Run(Double Click) the AscInstall.bat file.  This is a batch fille that will open a cmd window that does all the necessary changes to your Long War install to make Ascension
work.  If you're curious what it is doing right click it and select edit.

	NOTE: This is the mod installer and will install the files necessary into the appropriate locations.  It may not run properly if you do not have a fresh Long War 1.0
	install which will prevent the mod from working.  This Creates a backup of your existing Long War files to be used for the uninstall.  Also if you download Ascension
	from anywhere besides nexusmods.com it's not advised to trust any .bat files you see inside.


UNINSTALLATION

1. Run(Double Click) the AscLWRestore.bat file.  This is a batch fille that will open a cmd window that will uninstall the Ascension mod and will restore your Long War 1.0.
If you're curious what it is doing right click it and select edit.

	NOTE: This is the mod uninstaller and will restore all the files that our installer made changes to.  Do not delete any of the backup files created, these can be found
	in the AscBackup folder.  Before your first install this folder should be empty.  Also if you download Ascension from anywhere besides nexusmods.com it's not advised
	to trust any .bat files you see inside.
